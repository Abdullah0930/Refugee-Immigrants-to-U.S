# U.S-First Generation Refugees

Executive Summary
My Capstone project will be exploring first generation Refugee families and that especially come from conflict zones and resettled in the U.S in search of better opportunity. I’ll further do some descriptive analysis and weigh living arrangements of the first gen. Refugee immigrants to these that lived in U.S for Generation. My motivation is to learn more about some challenges that mostly first-generation Refugee families face as they resettle in U.S and tips that might ease their transition. The question I’m looking to answer what the trends overtime for Refugees are coming U.S and which countries are they coming from. Next, I further would like to explore first generation Refugee families and students and the challenges they face as they resettle in a whole new country like U.S compared to these that have been here for generations. I’ll also come up with list of recommendation that can help be more helpful etc. The goal is to get relevant data, cleaning, and insights which lead to good story. 

Motivation
As refugee immigrant who came to America in the 2005 as a kid, one of the things I love the most about the United States is its diversity & how it welcomes these that seek better opportunity. Most if not all these people came from different parts of the world for Educational and mostly for Job opportunities like my family. However, the challenge of being acquainted with new and highly developed county like U.S can be very difficult especially for immigrant families and their Kids. Therefore, that is why I wanted to look more into the lifestyles of Refugee families in U.S.
Data Question:
1.	Define the differences between first generation Refugee family and other immigrants?
2.	What are the arrival rates of Refugee families to U.S from 1980 to 2019?
3.    What are the top 10 countries that Refugees that resettle in U.S come from in 2004 and how that is relevant to you?
4.     Touch on struggles of being a Refugee child and how we can help?
6.	What are some recommendations that can result in more awareness and better help for first-generation Refugee families in general?
