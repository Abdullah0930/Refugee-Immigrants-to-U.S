# First Generation Refugees in U.S

Executive Summary

My Capstone project will be exploring Refugees trends that especially come from conflict zones before/after resettled in the U.S in search of better opportunity. My motivation is to learn more about some challenges that mostly first-generation Refugee families face as they resettle in U.S and tips that might ease their transition. The question I’m looking to answer what the trends overtime for Refugees are coming U.S and which countries are they coming from etc. Next, I further would like to explore first generation Refugee families and the challenges they face as they resettle in a whole new country like U.S compared to these that have been here for generations. I’ll also come up with list of recommendation that can help be more helpful etc. The goal is to get relevant data, cleaning, and insights which lead to good story. 

Motivation
As refugee immigrant who came to America in the 2005 as a kid, one of the things I love the most about the United States is its diversity & how it welcomes these that seek better opportunity. Most if not all these people came from different parts of the world for Educational and mostly for Job opportunities like my family. However, the challenge of being acquainted with new and highly developed county like U.S can be very difficult especially for immigrant families and their Kids. Therefore, that is why I wanted to look more into the lifestyles of Refugees abroad and in U.S.
